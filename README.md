# Design TODOs
1. What are the agents are doing
* Resource Gathering

2. What are the that things exist in the world that is being simulated
3. Communication / Negotiation Pipeline




# (Unimplemented) Ideas for MARL solution
1. Use MAPPO (Multi Agent PPO) but modify it 
2. Use a Learned Reawrd Function as in the work of Miyake (2024) 
3. Use a CTDE scheme
