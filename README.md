# TODOs

APR W1 
* Demand Heat Map implementation - inspired by an idea on Flatland env -- instead of just having demand be global, make it "localized" in the sense that each cell in the world has an associated order demand which must be met using orders.

APR W2 - W3 
* Proper MARL-ification of the environment (thus far) - set the environment to properly use a MARL algorithm following a CTDE approach. 
* Reward Crediting Problem - for MARL, the reward is treated as global. However, this is not ideal for getting the agents to learn

APR W3 - W4 
* Configuration for factory layout task
