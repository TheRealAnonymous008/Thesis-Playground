# Design TODOs
1. What are the agents are doing
* Resources can be used to make new materials 
* TODO: Implement a more robust system to manage agent inventory
2. What are the that things exist in the world that is being simulated
3. Communication / Negotiation Pipeline

Model agent desires and preferences
- Heterogeneity by adding preference functions (different for each agent) applied to the items that the agent currently owns. Take inspo from BDI 


# (Unimplemented) Ideas for MARL solution
1. Use MAPPO (Multi Agent PPO) but modify it 
2. Use a Learned Reawrd Function as in the work of Miyake (2024) 
3. Use a CTDE scheme
