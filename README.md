# Design TODOs

Model agent desires and preferences
- Heterogeneity by adding preference functions (different for each agent) applied to the items that the agent currently owns. Take inspo from BDI 
- Add crafting time in the recipe.

# (Unimplemented) Ideas for MARL solution
1. Use MAPPO (Multi Agent PPO) but modify it 
2. Use a Learned Reawrd Function as in the work of Miyake (2024) 
3. Use a CTDE scheme
